# Music-Engine
This semester, I audited a Web Design class just for fun, and this was my final project. This project is essentially a soundcloud clone (a worse clone, I might add). However, it is targeted less at music-listening consumers and more at labels/executives searching for new musical talent and talent that is trying to get discovered.

The code is written in HTML/CSS/PHP/JavaScript and uses a database created using mySQL, which I interact with using SQL. AJAX was also used to handle the dynamic like/unliking of tracks (so a user could like a track and have the like-button change color as well as a query sent without refreshing the page or stopping the playback of a current song).
